<ol>
    <h3>step 1: Prepare the Chhena (Paneer)</h3>
    <br>
Heat 1 liter full-fat milk in a pan until it reaches a boil.
<br>

Lower the heat and add 2 tbsp lemon juice (mixed with 1 cup water), stirring gently.
<br>

When the milk curdles completely, turn off the heat. If needed, add a little more lemon juice.
<br>

Strain the curdled milk using a muslin cloth or a fine sieve.
<br>
Rinse the chhena under cold water to remove the lemon's sourness.
<br>
Squeeze out excess water and let it rest for 30 minutes to drain completely.
<br>
<h3>Step 2: Knead the Chhena </h3>
<br>

Transfer the chhena to a plate and knead it for 8-10 minutes until smooth and soft.
<br>
Divide the mixture into small equal-sized balls, rolling them smoothly without cracks.
<br>
<h3>Step 3: Prepare the Sugar Syrup</h3>
<br>
In a large pot, add 2 cups sugar and 5 cups water and bring to a boil.
<br>
Add 2-3 crushed cardamom pods and rose water (optional) for flavor.
<br>
<h3>Step 4: Cook the Rasgullas</h3>
<br>
Gently drop the chhena balls into the boiling syrup.
<br>
Cover the pot and boil for 15 minutes on medium heat. The rasgullas will double in size.
<br>
After cooking, turn off the heat and let them cool in the syrup.
<br>
<h3>Step 5: Serve</h3>

Chill the rasgullas in the syrup for at least 4-5 hours before serving.
